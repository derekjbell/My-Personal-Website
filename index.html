        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p> Currently, I am completeing an 8-month software engineering internship at CanAssist. Here I have been leading the development of an iOS app that is able to take patient limb measurements using augmented reality. This app has a full backend server and sync between any iDevice using Google Firestore. Besides this I have been updating and bugfixing various other iOS apps that are available for download on the app store. I have also completed a 4-month entrepreneurial software engineering internship where I was able to present the idea to an investor, and recieved $10,000 to develop a concussion rehabilitation app using Unity. This app used multiple object tracking to assess a patient's condition. Besides Swift, my top languages are Python, C++, C, C#, JavaScript. This website is a showcase of my HTML and CSS knowledge.</p>

        <h3>3D CAD Modelling & 3D Printing</h3>
        <p>For the past 2 years, I have been a volunteer and completed 2 4-month co-op terms at the <a href="https://www.victoriahandproject.com">Victoria Hand Project</a>. This led to me becoming extremely proficient at CAD programs such as SolidWorks and AutoDesk Fusion 360. Further, I have developed expert experience in 3D printing through creating custom 3D printed upper-limb prosthetic devices for the developing world.  </p>
